UK – Evacuations and Rescues After Storm Henk Leaves Widespread Flooding,"4 January, 2024","Heavy rain from consecutive storms, most recently Storm Henk, has left wide areas of the United Kingdom under water once again. Dozens of people have been rescued from vehicles trapped in flood waters. Firefighters and police have also carried out evacuations in parts of Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. Ground has been saturated for some time across the UK following a series of winter storms. Storm Henk comes just days after Storm Gerrit hit in late December 2023. Storm Babet flooded thousands of homes in October 2023. In the last days of 2023, parts of Scotland and northern England suffered as a result of strong winds and heavy rain brought by Storm Gerrit. Several roads were closed in North Yorkshire where flooding and severe weather were blamed for the deaths of 3 people trapped in a vehicle in the River Esk near the town of Glaisdale on 28 December 2023. Firefighters also rescued people from vehicles trapped in floods in nearby Houlsyke and Kirby Wiske. In the following days the overflowing River Ouse flooded roads and left the village of Naburn isolated. Further south, heavy rain flooded a railway tunnel in Kent, England, severely interrupting Eurostar services between London and Paris. Roads were flooded in parts of Essex where 2 people were rescued after vehicles became trapped. The UK Met Office warned Storm Henk would bring further severe weather including strong winds and heavy rain from 02 January 2024. Wide areas of England and Wales recorded more than 40 mm of rain in 24 hours. River levels increased and the Environment Agency issued more than 250 flood warnings for areas of England. By 02 January dozens of roads were reported flooded in areas of of the West Midlands, East Midlands and East Anglia. Firefighters and police carried out flood rescues in Shropshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, among others. Bystanders rescued a child and driver from a car sinking in floodwater under a bridge over the River Cole near Sarehole Mill museum in Birmingham. Authorities reported people were evacuated from a caravan park in Great Billing, Northampton, following the rise of the Nene River. Levels of the river at the measuring gauge at Nene Valley jumped to 1.63 metres on 03 January, 2024, just 1 cm below the record high seen on 24 December 2020. Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) said, “Twenty-nine adults and two children, along with a number of pets have been evacuated today as part of the rescue operations. Crews are continuing to carry out a systematic search of the 1,750 static homes. They have made contact with and evacuated everyone who wanted to leave, however, a small number of residents have chosen to remain in their properties.” Northamptonshire Police said a further evacuation of around 130 people who remained in caravans on the Billing Aquadrome site would take place on 03 January. As is often the case following heavy rain in England and Wales, the Severn river rose to dangerously high levels. Temporary flood defences were raised along the banks of the river in several locations including Bewdley and Shrewsbury. The BBC reported hundreds of properties near the Severn in the West Midlands were flooded, in some cases for the fourth time this winter. Areas of the city of Worcester were flooded and some homes were evacuated. Flood waters from the Severn and Avon rivers surrounded the town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire. Storm Henk is the first named storm of 2024 in the UK and the eighth so far this winter. Strong winds from the storm also caused widespread damage. One person died after a tree fell on a vehicle near Kemble in Gloucestershire. The Energy Networks Association reported power outages affected 107,000 homes during the peak of the storm. The Met Office issued further warnings for heavy rain across the south of England from 04 to 05 January. As of 04 January, 273 flood warnings (flooding is expected) and 294 flood alerts (flooding is possible) were in place across England.

UK – Government Declares Major Incident Over Flood Risk in Somerset,"19 January, 2023","The government in the UK has declared a major incident over flood risk in the southwestern county of Somerset, England. England’s Environment Agency (EA) in partnership with local authorities has taken a decision to declare a major incident on the Somerset Levels to ensure local partners can take a coordinated response to recent flooding. The EA stressed that this is a precautionary move and imminent flooding to properties is not expected, however, the risk of flooding will remain for the coming week. The Somerset Levels and Moors are designed to store flood water when the rivers flowing through them overtop. The recent heavy rain in England caused spillways (specifically designed low points in the riverbanks) on the Rivers Tone and Parrett to overflow and the excess water is stored on the moors. The area has suffered major flooding in recent years, most notably during the winter of 2013 to 2014. A pumping operation started last week and additional pumps were deployed on 17 January at Northmoor to reduce the amount of water being stored at Currymoor. The EA expects water levels to reduce in Northmoor, Saltmoor and Currymoor now that river levels have dropped low enough to allow pumping. But declaring a major incident is a sensible step so partners can stay coordinated and ready to respond should the situation worsen. Ian Withers of the Environment Agency said, “The sight of water on the Somerset Levels and Moors is obviously a concern to those who have suffered from flooding before. Our staff continue to work to the best of their abilities to protect people and properties, install pumps and engage with communities. “The situation is expected to improve when enhanced pumping begins and we continue to run the Sowy flood relief channel, it is prudent to plan for the worst and going into major incident mode is appropriate, so we coordinate with partners and everyone is ready to respond if needed.” A period of heavy rain that began around 09 January 2023 caused rivers to rise in several parts of England and Wales. The Environment Agency installed temporary flood barriers along rising rivers at Bewdley in Worcestershire and in Ironbridge and Shrewsbury in Shropshire, among others. The Environment Agency said that a total of 130 properties across England suffered flood damage across the country. However, over 5,000 properties were protected across the West Midlands, Yorkshire, in the South West and along the Thames. As of 18 January, the Environment Agency teams were responding to flooding incidents in Somerset, flood risk in the Bristol Avon area and monitoring rising groundwater levels in Dorset. Below is a selection of some of the significant river levels seen in parts of England from 12 to 15 January 2023.

"Trees and Woodlands Delivering £400m Boost to UK’s Flood Protection Efforts, Study Finds","16 January, 2023","New research by Forest Research estimates Great Britain’s trees contribute over £400m annually in benefits in the fight against floods. Trees and woodlands have long been known to play a vital role in flood resilience, but scientists are now able to establish the financial contribution they make in protecting communities from flooding. The flood regulation service of Great Britain’s trees, forests and woodlands as an annualised central estimate gave annual values of £843 million and £420 million compared to bare soil and grass, respectively. The valuation is based on the role trees, woodlands and forests play in intercepting rainfall, storing water and reducing the potentially devastating surface runoff that causes flooding. Given the increased likelihood and frequency of extreme weather events as a result of climate change, the report highlights how woodland expansion can be a natural, cost-effective method of protecting homes and businesses – now and for the future. Forestry Minister Trudy Harrison said, “Communities across the country know all too well the potentially devastating impacts of flooding – from damage to homes and businesses and the disruption of critical infrastructure to the tragic loss of life. “This report provides the best picture yet of the integral role that our trees, woodlands and forests play in protecting at-risk communities from flooding. With more severe weather events forecast in the future, there is even more incentive to accelerate our tree planting efforts in line with our ambitious target to treble planting rates in England.” Forests help to reduce flooding in numerous ways, in what is referred to as a ‘sponge effect’. Firstly, evaporation from leaves and branches helps to reduce the amount of rainfall reaching the ground. This process, known as interception, is significantly greater for woodland compared to other land use types. Secondly, the soils within forests receive, store and delay water, helping to reduce rapid run-off and peak flows. Finally, the presence of trees, shrubs and large woody dams along rivers and on the floodplain creates a barrier effect that slows the passage of flood waters downstream, in addition to delivering biodiversity benefits. As a result, tree planting can significantly affect the volume, pathway and timing of surface run-off, reducing the risk of downstream flooding. Responsible forestry management practices help to maintain and secure this key environmental service. Environment Agency Chief Executive, Sir James Bevan said, “The warning signs of the climate crisis are stark and mounting – with greater rainfall, higher tides and more violent weather bringing heightened risks of serious flooding over the years ahead. The hard flood defences which the Environment Agency builds and maintains all across the country are part of the solution. So too are Natural Flood Management techniques such as tree planting, which we are already using to slow the flow of water and help protect homes and businesses. “By harnessing the power of nature, we can tackle the twin challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change – whilst simultaneously reducing the risk of flooding to vulnerable communities.” The full study is available here.

England’s Environment Agency Emphasizes Importance of Natural Flood Management,"9 December, 2022","The Chief Executive of the Environment Agency (EA) in England, UK has emphasized the importance of natural flood management in the fight against growing flood risk and climate change. In a report published by the Environment Agency, Chief Executive Sir James Bevan outlined his vision for natural flood management to be seen as a core part of the nation’s defence against flooding, alongside its programme of “crucial bricks and mortar hard defences”. The report evaluates the impact of the national Natural Flood Management Program, which received £15 million in government funding, and found that it had created an equivalent of 1.6 million cubic meters of water storage and increased flood resilience to 15,000 homes. In addition, the programme contributed to nature recovery: improving 4,000 hectares of habitat, improving 610 kilometres of river and planting 100 hectares of woodland. Sir James Bevan said, “The warning signs of the climate crisis are stark – and sadly devastating flooding is likely to become a more familiar sight over the next century. “As we prepare for more extreme weather events, we must use every weapon in our armoury and Natural Flood Management will play an essential role in this. “By harnessing the power of nature alongside our traditional flood defences, we can not only help keep communities safer but also create wildlife havens and tackle the climate emergency.” Natural flood management (NFM) helps to slow the flow of water across the landscape – including the re-meandering of rivers, the restoration of wetlands and targeted woodland planting. NFM measures include planting trees and hedges to absorb more water, creating leaky barriers to slow water flow in streams and ditches and restoring salt marshes, mudflats, and peat bogs. Examples can be found in Somerset and Yorkshire. In fact between 2017 and 2021, EA invested £15 million of government funding to benefit people and learn more about NFM through 60 pilots across England. Of these, 26 were catchment scale pilots led by risk management authorities and 34 were community scale pilots led by local groups and charities (see map). Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said, “We know that flooding can have a devastating impact on people’s lives, homes and livelihoods. That is why we are investing a record £5.2 billion in flood and coastal defences to ensure more communities are better prepared – and nature-based solutions are a key component of this. “The additional benefits of Natural Flood Management for people and wildlife are vast – helping us reach our ambitious Net Zero targets, providing vital new habitats and creating areas of natural beauty for people to enjoy for generations to come.” EnglandGreen InfrastructureLow Impact DevelopmentSustainable Drainage Systems",https://floodlist.com/protection/englands-environment-agency-natural-flood-management
UK’s Climate is Getting Warmer and Wetter Says Met Office,"2 August, 2021","The Met Office says the UK is getting warmer and sunnier but also wetter as a result of climate change. 2020 was third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record for the UK. The latest analysis of the UK climate, State of the UK Climate 2020 published in The Royal Meteorological Society’s ‘International Journal of Climatology’, has shown that climate change is already being felt across the UK. All of the top-ten warmest years for the UK in records back to 1884 have occurred since 2002, and, for central England, the 21st century so far has been warmer than the previous three centuries. Lead author and Senior Climate Scientist at the Met Office, Mike Kendon, said: “2020 was another notable year for the UK climate, with records broken for daily rainfall and monthly sunshine hours. Average temperatures for the UK continue to climb, with nearly a degree of warming when comparing the most recent 30 years with the preceding 30-year period. Last year saw some significant weather extremes including severe flooding from heavy rainfall in February and a major heatwave in early August.” The last 30-year period (1991-2020) has been 0.9°C warmer than the preceding 30 years (1961-1990). The warming trend is evident across all months and all countries in the UK. As well as increased temperatures, the UK has been on average 6% wetter over the last 30 years (1991-2020) than the preceding 30 years (1961-1990). Six of the ten wettest years for the UK in a series from 1862 have occurred since 1998. Storms Ciara and Dennis, hitting the UK only one week apart, were part of the UK’s wettest February on record, and brought devastating flooding affecting many homes and businesses. Most of the UK received more than twice the February long-term average rainfall, with 300% quite widely in the north and west, and over 400% in parts of the Pennines. The UK has had its wettest February in 2020, December in 2015, April and June in 2012 and November in 2009 – five out of 12 months – in little over a decade.  The average sea-surface temperature in 2020 for near-coast waters around the UK was 11.9°C, 0.5°C above the 1981-2010 long-term average. This was the eighth-warmest year for UK near-coast sea-surface temperatures in records dating back to 1870. In the most recent decade (2011-2020) sea-surface temperatures have been 0.7°C warmer than the 1961–1990 average, and nine of the ten warmest years in near-coast sea-surface temperatures have occurred since 2002. Sea level rise has accelerated in the UK over recent years. The rate of sea level rise has been 1.5mm/yr from the start of the 20th century, however, for the period 1993-2019 it has increased to over 3mm/yr.

Japan’s Experience With Earthquakes Can Help Teach Us to Learn to Live With Floods,"17 March, 2020","The intense rainfall from storms this winter has caused severe flooding in numerous cities across the UK. The storms have left at least eight people dead, and economic losses have been estimated at a few billion pounds. The government has responded by announcing flood defence spending will be doubled to £5.2 billion pounds over the next five years. Such severe flooding may seem like a rare event, but – as those living in the most flood-prone areas will tell you – it is not. There was flooding to a similar if not greater extent between December 2013 and January 2014, which killed 17 people and cost £1.3 billion in economic losses. At the time the Met Office reported that it was the wettest Dececember-January period on record. There was also major flooding across the UK in 2016, and previously in 2009, 2007 and 2000, and flooding of lesser extent in other years as well. What this suggests is that regularity of major flooding in the UK has dropped from every 15 to 30 years as it was over the 20th century, to between every two to seven years today. More frequent major flooding puts unprecedented pressure on flood defences, with insufficient time and resources to recover between major events as in the past. We need to acknowledge that in the UK – as is the case elsewhere – flood defences are 20th century approaches now ill-suited to tackle what the 21st century is throwing at us. Civil engineers have usually been employed to build “hard” structural solutions, such as more and higher concrete walls and soil embankments around rivers. But this may no longer be the best approach in the face of the recurring intense weather patterns and associated flooding. The fundamental assumptions that underpin structural solutions are that the environmental pressures they are built to meet do not substantially change over time. Clearly, this is no longer the case. The UK government’s announcement of greater investment in flood defences is welcome, but this does not necessarily mean building longer and higher walls. What is needed is an integrated approach to flood defence that goes beyond using only structural solutions. Now, in the first decades of the century, the UK is in a period of transition that presents the opportunity to adjust our flood defences to the requirements of what this century’s climate will bring. In the years before the second world war, Japan faced the issue of building its resilience to earthquakes. Japan experiences on average at least one or two earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 to 7 or greater every year. These earthquakes used to kill many thousands of people, but the average death toll has significantly decreased and has fallen to a few tens of people in recent years (with exceptions, such as the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the earthquake that caused the 2011 tsunami). This has been achieved through a programme that combines technological development and significant public involvement. Japan holds annual and even monthly earthquake drills in schools and other public and private sector organisations. There is also earthquake education in schools and public information campaigns as well as nationwide earthquake warning messages through mobile phones. In earthquake or tsunami danger zones there are detailed signs to indicate areas at risk. These social approaches are pillars of Japan’s earthquake resilience programme, standing alongside the cutting-edge technological development of recent decades, such as seismic base isolation and motion-absorbing technology. The main outcome of Japan’s public education campaign has been that most people understand that while earthquakes cannot be prevented, their destructive impacts can be minimised, and that everyone has a role to play. This has been instrumental in bringing government and public together in building a more earthquake-resilient society. In fact, Japan has turned its massive challenge to an opportunity: protecting its economy and communities against earthquakes while becoming the leader in earthquake-mitigation technologies: state-of-the-art know-how that it exports to the world. Many nations worldwide struggle with flooding. Along with the Netherlands, Britain has been a pioneer in flood defence infrastructure engineering. This is an opportunity for the UK to not only address its flooding problems properly at home, but also to build on its existing reputation and take a leading role worldwide in developing new flood defence technology. To begin with, an information campaign is needed to inform the public of the new reality. Everyone should know that flooding is now a frequent risk – it may have been affordable to get flooded every 15 to 30 years in the past, but few can bear the expense of being flooded out of their home every few years as is possible now. The public must be properly informed that it is not technically possible to achieve zero flooding – and that in order to protect larger, denser populations in towns and cities, it may be necessary to accept flooding in other areas. Politicians and experts need to be honest with communities living in flood-prone areas that, given the current circumstances and the potential for the situation worsening in the future, there will need to be a managed retreat from areas deemed to too difficult or costly to protect. And people need to understand that pouring concrete everywhere is not the answer. Greater walls and hard surface areas serve only to guide rainwater into the river channel, which then subsequently bursts its banks. Instead, it would be better to strive to keep surfaces in their natural, permeable states through more widespread use of sustainable drainage systems. The storms that sweep across Europe form thousands of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean or in the deserts of North Africa – highlighting the importance of international cooperation to identify and coordinate actions to minimise the effects of global warming. At home, regular flood drills and flood education combined with flood signage in communities at risk are avenues that need to be pursued seriously. In the medium and long term, these efforts may help everyone understand that flooding is not a rare occurrence nor a one-off problem to be solved, but a natural phenomenon to be lived with. Flooding cannot be prevented, but the way we approach it can bring relief, and opportunities, for our communities and economy.

UK – Flash Floods Hit Southern England,"20 December, 2019","Update, 21 December 2019: Further heavy rain from 19 to 20 December flooded roads in parts of South East England. Heavy rain also triggered landslips along railway lines, severely disrupting train services, according to BBC reports. Flooding caused chaos on roads in Essex, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk in East England. Parts of the M23 motorway near Crawley were closed, disrupting traffic to Gatwick Airport. Drivers were rescued from flood waters near Bishop’s Stortford, Essex, and also in Suffolk, West Sussex and Kent. The small town of Edenbridge in Kent was flooded after the River Eden burst its banks. https://twitter.com/BStortPolice/status/1208008098818011137

Original report, 20 December 2019: Heavy rain and strong winds hit parts of southern England from 18 to 19 December, 2019, causing flash flooding which damaged homes and disrupted transport. The worst hit area was Hayle in Cornwall, where as many as 50 homes and businesses were flooded. Cornwall Fire and Rescue were called in to help pump flooded areas. A major road near Hayle was closed due to flooding, prompting Devon and Cornwall Police to declare a major incident. Several vehicles were stranded in the flood water. The road has since re-opened. Devon and Cornwall Police said: “Due to recent heavy rain there is localised flooding across Devon and Cornwall making a number of roads impassable. Stay safe, drive with extra care, take notice of road closure signs and avoid driving into standing water at all times.” Roads were also flooded near Dorchester in Dorset. Rail travel was disrupted after flooding near Southampton blocked railway lines and heavy rain triggered a landslip blocking railway tracks in Liss, Hampshire. The UK’s Met Office has issued Yellow Level warnings for rain in parts of southern and eastern England until 22 December. As of 20 December there were 47 flood warnings and 194 flood alerts in place across England, mostly in the south and west. Meanwhile media in Ireland reported that a storm, named Storm Elsa, caused flooding on the west coast late on 18 December, 2109. Storm surge, high waves combined with a high tide swamped parts of Galway City, including Salthill, The Spanish Arch and The Galway Docks. Dozens of cars were damaged.

UK – Brunel University London Launches Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience,"25 April, 2018","A new centre to help bolster the UK’s defences against flooding has launched at Brunel University London, offering a range of accredited e-learning programmes aimed at professionals from mid-September.  The Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience (CFR2) – which has been developed in partnership with the Environment Agency, and the environmental organisations HR Wallingford, Jacobs, ICE Blue and CIWEM – aims to help fill the skills gap currently faced by the sector. Backed by £200,000 from HEFCE’s Catalyst Fund, CFR2 will offer a suite of Chartered Institution of Water and Environment Management (CIWEM) accredited e-learning programmes aimed at professionals, before being expanded to include Brunel’s undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses in Flood and Coastal Engineering, which have run at the university since 2017. The first e-learning courses are expected to go online in mid-September. Professor Tassos Karayiannis of Brunel’s College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences and Director of the CFR2, said: “The Centre will complement our existing undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Flood and Coastal Engineering, which are offered alongside HR Wallingford and supported by the Environment Agency. “The Centre will provide new CIWEM accredited e-learning materials developed with our partners for new learners at both pre and post-university level, and at the same time offer an opportunity for an upgrade to professionals working in the field. “This will help reduce the national and international skills gap for professionals working in this multidisciplinary field.” The Catalyst Fund, launched by HEFCE before it became the Office for Students, aims to support the Government’s Industrial Strategy by developing the curriculum in areas of national importance. In total, £6.1m was awarded to 30 universities across the UK, with Brunel receiving the maximum amount possible for a single institution. Terry Fuller, Chief Executive of CIWEM, said: “The training of professionals to meet our global challenges of flood and coastal erosion risk management is a priority for CIWEM. We are pleased to support the development and accreditation of the courses offered by the centre” Paul Cross, Senior Skills, Efficiency and Resilience Advisor at the Environment Agency, said: “The Centre for Flood Resilience holds a great deal of promise and potential to enhance the skills and capabilities of those working in the sector, empower communities at risk through education and inspire future generations to forge an exciting career within the sector.” England",https://floodlist.com/protection/brunel-university-london-launches-centre-for-flood-risk-and-resilience
